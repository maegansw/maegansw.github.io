			<h2> A Little About Me </h2>
			<section>
				<p class="describe">I have always had an interest in the art and design space and I really love storytelling. 
					From a young age Iâ€™ve always been in love with storytelling. I  was alwasy fascinate by how well i could relate 
					to these stories, and how I could always see a part of me in the charatcers portrayed in movies. All stoies are 
					built around a universal truth or a moral. I aspire to translate these feeling of relatability into design. I think 
					the best way to do this would be through UX desn as I would be telling the story of the user. I hope the user can 
					see themselves in my design. I want consumers to think, wow they really thoguht of me when they design this.</p>

					<p class="describe"> Currently, I am currently learning the fundamentals of Digital Marketing to better understand what drives consumer 
					behavior, and learn the best practices on how to reach a desired audience. </p>

				<p class="describe">I think joining The Knowledge House would be a great opportunity. 
					I think the learning model of 1 year really gives me the chance to learn. I would also be surrounded 
					by not only like minded- peers but culturallry and ethnicaly liked, which i think is an invaluable experience. 
					This is the main appeal for me, being able to see success stories from others who went thrpugh the process who 
					are Black and ot Latin American I also believe in the companys mission of helping young adults break into the 
					tech field as it is. Not many programs focus on I felt compelled to join the program this is an opportunity 
					that I did not want to miss. Especially in the Bronx. </p>
