				<p class="describe">I have always had an interest in the art and design space and I really love storytelling. 
					From a young age Iâ€™ve always been in love with storytelling. I  was alwasy fascinate by how well i could relate 
					to these stories, and how I could always see a part of me in the charatcers portrayed in movies. All stoies are 
					built around a universal truth or a moral. I aspire to translate these feeling of relatability into design. I think 
					the best way to do this would be through UX desn as I would be telling the story of the user. I hope the user can 
					see themselves in my design. I want consumers to think, wow they really thoguht of me when they design this.</p>

					<p class="describe"> Currently, I am currently learning the fundamentals of Digital Marketing to better understand what drives consumer 
					behavior, and learn the best practices on how to reach a desired audience. </p>
