			<h2> A Little About Me </h2>
			<section>
				<p class="describe">I have always had an interest in design and storytelling. From a young age, Iâ€™ve always been in love with stories- how they connect people, cultures, and heritages. They are a powerful way to make us feel connected to one another. I think this power lies in the ability to be understood by another person. Relatability allows for understanding, it allows for emotional connections, and it allows for better communication and experiences. I aspire to translate these feelings of understanding and emotional connections into my designs. UX/Ui design is the perfect medium for this as the focus is not on the design/ product, but on the person who will most likely interact with the product/design. I want to tell the story of the user so I can create better experiences for them.</p>

					<p class="describe"> Currently, I am currently learning the fundamentals of Digital Marketing to better understand what drives consumer 
					behavior, and learn the best practices on how to reach a desired audience. </p>

			<h2> Why Join TKH? </h2>

			<section>
				<p class="describe">I think joining The Knowledge House would be a great opportunity for me to fully immerse myself in learning UX/UI Design. The learning model of one year gives me a chance to properly learn the fundamental design principles, create my unique projects, participate in technology events, network with my peers and mentors, and have fun learning. Unlike the other boot camps, the process would not feel rushed. All good things take time, and I feel TKH values this notion. What I find to be invaluable about the TKH learning experience is the ability to have a network of ethnically and culturally similar people to myself. Reading the success stories from previous fellows about how they were able to find jobs and now thriving in their careers, gave me hope that one day I will be like them. As a black woman trying to break into the tech space, it can be difficult to find camaraderie in a white male-dominated field. Having a support system would motive and push me to do my best every day.
